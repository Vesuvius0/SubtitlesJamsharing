19
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:51,983
l've just moved in, across the landing.

20
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,341
Er, yes.

21
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:58,385
l...wondered if you could
help me with something.

22
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,024
Sure.

l mean, the reason l came over...

26
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:23,342
is...

27
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:27,510
because l think
l've found a lump in my breast.

28
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,588
Oh.

29
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,430

Erm... Well, yes. Erm...

31

Erm...

33
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:48,151
Well, l suppose...l could.

00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,944
Thanks.

l...

37
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:55,582

Slap me?

39
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,220
l couldn't just let you
touch my breast, could l?

No, suppose not.

41

Erm...not sure.

48
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,306
Maybe you should...

49
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:32,105
feel it without any fabric in the way.

50
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:44,386
OK, that...that might be a good idea.

51

00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:25,942
Why don't you feel it with your mouth?

Er...OK.

l'm Alison Shive

141
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:52,062
and this is our daughter, Judy.

142
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:57,907
(Graham) We've always had
a strong feeling with Judy

143
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:03,549
that she's not just a little girl -
she's a 45-year-old man...

144
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:06,152
trapped in the body of a little girl.

145
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,467
So she's had an operation

146
00:10:09,512 --> 00:10:12,424
to be fitted with the penis
and testicle glands

147
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:14,463
of a 45-year-old man.

148
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:23,303
Look at that.

149
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,543
You see, it's perfect.

150
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:30,870
We're particularly pleased with the balls.

151
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,028
Yeah.

152
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:35,222
l think the balls are excellent.

153
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:42,029
And you're a lot happier now,
aren't you, love?

154
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:51,983
- Ta.
- Ah, cheers.

No, look, here.

00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,223
Where did that come from?

- Er, we were...
- We were kissing.

170
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,344
Kissing!

171
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:11,270
- No, we were...
- Come on, we'll be late.

172
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:13,223
lt starts in two minutes.

173
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,740
- We've found something out.
- Come on!

174
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:18,386
- Helen, we... We...
- Let them go.

175
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,468
See you. Bye, Rich.

176
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,783
Are you all right?

177
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:30,866
Hm?

178
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,709
Yeah.

179
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,669
So, what can l do for you?

180
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:49,387
They said we should come in
for that spot thing.

181
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:51,821
Yeah, l think it's a wheat allergy.

182
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,103
Yeah. We just want something for it.

183
00:12:56,152 --> 00:13:00,031
lt's certainly not an ailment.
You're gonna have a baby.

184
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,666
W-What are you talking about?

185
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,703
There. lt's in there.

186
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:13,067
Can't you just give her an injection?
Get rid of the spot.

187
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,821
lt's not a spot.

188
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,181
The lump is caused by a baby.

189
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,623
(Man) How's a baby get in there?

190
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:24,742
lt... You put it in.

191
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,783
No, l did not.

192
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:30,108
No, but when you have sex,
that makes a baby.

193
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:35,351
lt doesn't! lt just makes a bit of foam.

194
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:39,988
Look, l can show you.
When your penis goes...

195
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:43,661
Hey! We don't want
to see your sick little pictures.

196
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:46,829
Spending all day drawing them
rubbing yourself up.

197
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:51,145
Look, there really is a baby in there.

198
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:54,150
- All right, how's it breathe, then?
- lt doesn't.

199
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:57,821
lt don't breathe!
What is it? Dead, then, is it?

200
00:13:57,872 --> 00:14:00,591
lt gets its oxygen through a cord.

201
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,987
(Laughing) Oh, it's electric, now!

202
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,023
lt's a fucking light bulb.

203
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,903
This may seem very strange

204
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:10,388
but you are going to have a baby
and l should examine you.

205
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,423
Yeah, right.

206
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:16,704
- You just want a feel of my twit.
-Really, l...

207
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,550
You're talking rubbish
so you can feel her twit.

208
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,744
Of course l don't want to. l need to
examine her for the sake of the baby.

209
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,306
There ain't no baby. lt's my stomach!

210
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,661
Look, it's not in your stomach.

211
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:32,022
- You just said it was!
- No, l said it was in there.

212
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,586
She doesn't even know
what a stomach is!

213
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:37,192
lt's a womb and there's a baby in there.

214
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,985
lf there's a baby,
how come it's not crying?

215
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,830
- They don't cry when...
- Babies don't cry?

216
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,022
Babies don't cry! Listen to you.

217
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:47,666
You're not a doctor, you're a wanker.

218
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:51,307
Yeah! You're not a doctor,
you're a wanker!

219
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:55,743
OK, all right, it's not a baby, it's a spot.
Yes, l'm sorry.

220
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,307
l'll prescribe you one litre of spot cream.

221
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:02,185
Put a handful on your belly
three times a day

222
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,826
and come back if it doesn't go away.

223
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:08,826
Thank you, Doctor.

224
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:12,945
You could be reported for trying
to muck around in her squishy.

225
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,823
Please.

226
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:17,863
(Woman) lt better be a spot,

227
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:21,302
not another one of them
screaming red rabbit things.

228
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:28,670
l think...really...

229
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:32,341
she ought to be put to sleep.

230
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,423
Right.

231
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,463
Straightaway.

232
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,747
Could l make love to her first?

233
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:49,592
Or maybe after you've given the
injection, just while she's slipping away?

234
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,832
l don't think so, really.

235
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:56,664
No.

236
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,227
lt was something l promised her
when she was a puppy.

237
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:04,589
Well, l don't think l could allow that

238
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,623
without reporting it.

239
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,507
ls that right?

240
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,383
Yes.

241
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,229
OK.

242
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:19,151
Well, just the usual injection, then.

243
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:26,067
You know, l'm pretty sure
she would have consented.

244
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:31,985
Perhaps you'd like to hold her while l...

245
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,626
No, l don't think so.

246
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:37,027
OK.

247
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:40,269
l'll just watch you do it
with my trousers down.

248
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:45,623
Right.

Well, as l said, it won't go away overnight

327
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:48,663
but it will go away in the end,

328
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,703
l promise you.

329
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:57,183
ln the meantime, just remember,

330
00:21:58,232 --> 00:22:01,508
there are many worse things

331
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,702
than wetting yourself.

332
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:09,151
After all, it's not a disease.

333
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,106
(Dripping)

334
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:30,543
Right.

335
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,222
(Squelching)

336
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,107
Ciao.
