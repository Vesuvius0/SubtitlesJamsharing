is he comes to the front door

Doctor...

72
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,611
lt's nice but...it's not the same.
Kind of more slinky.

73
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,810
Erm, could l stop now, please?

74
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,977
Oh, no, keep going.
This is quite important.

No.

Dr Basingstoke to pop through?

Thanks.

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,699
- Can l stop now?
- No. No, keep going.

83
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,970
Or, tell you what, jump up and down.

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,733
Wow, yes, that is powerful.

85
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,055
Do that too much
and it'll swing right up your arse.

86

l can get mine to swing up my arse, look.

- Really?

94

- But it's great.
- No, it's not great.

Right. ls this not necessary?

97

Yes. Sort of...

98
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,654
- Not particularly.
- Oh.

99
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,496
You too, please, Michael.

- Right, erm, it's Nick, isn't it?
- Nick Foster.

103
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,373
(Alison) Go next door
and they'll get you another appointment.

104
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,058
Right.

105
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,175
Michael, this has got to stop.

106
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,972
- Has it?
- Yes.

107
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,537
lt really has.

108
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,052
Yeah.

You're right.

Yeah.

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,857
Thanks, Alison.

113
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,771
- See you later.
- Yep.

114
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,015
- Alison?
- Yes?

115
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,609
l've probably got three more goes
at this before l get reported?

116
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,934
- No!
- Please?

117
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,809
- No.
- Please?

118

- Two.

'l spoke to the council
and they said there's nothing l can do.'

121
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,049
So, erm, l've decided
to lower the value of this place

122
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,853
to get my landlord where it hurts.

123

And, erm...

124
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,453
Vandalising it would
have been too obvious

125

generally.

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,653

'if it's covered in pussy rags -
very demoralising.'

139
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,335
Probably the best thing l've done...

140
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,010
is, erm, l've got a sausage griddle,
outside the tube station,

'because l've been threatened
with eviction.'

144

- l've come about the TV.
- Yeah, right. Come in.

150

Thank you. Brand-new one, is it?

- Yes.
- But not working?

but it's full of lizards.

- No?

set up properly.

But what about the lizards?

159
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,372
lt's a, er, it's a good picture.

160

l'm not having a TV
pouring lizards into my house.

Well, you see, they're not
really anything to do with me.

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,738
Yes, they are.
lt's a brand-new television,

163
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,135
it's not supposed to have lizards in it.

164
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,695
Well, you see,
it doesn't say anything about lizards.

165
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,210
Of course it bloody doesn't,
they're not meant to be there.

166
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,333
- What about the cable company?
- (Woman) lt's nothing to do with them!

167
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,372
- Have you checked?
- No, we haven't!

168
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,809
Well, l do suggest you check with them

169
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,249
and maybe they'll be able to help you.

170
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,816
Are you telling me the cable
company's sending us lizards?

171
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,578
Maybe, yes.

172
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,975
- (Woman) What?
- Down the wire.

173
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,534
By mistake.
Down the wire, the-the lizards...

174
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,617
Now, hang on.
Look, mate, it's quite simple.

175
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,176
You sold us the telly,
you delivered it yesterday, you set it up

176
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,769
and the first time we use it,
it starts pouring lizards.

177
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,697
So you come up with a solution.

178
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,935
- Sweep them up.
- Sweep them up?

179
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,289
- Yes.
- (Woman) You sweep them up!

180
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,776
- No, you sweep them up.
- What?

181
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,493
They're not really
anything to do with me.

182
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,010
ls that all you can say,
''nothing to do with me''? ls that it?

183
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,689
- Wipers?
- What?

184
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,891
Wipe them off the screen
with windscreen wipers.

185
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,534
- This is fucking ridiculous!
- No need to swear.

186
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,014
l can fucking swear
in my house if l want to!

187
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,178
- No need for that.
- What will your head office say?

188
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,495
- Yeah!
- That you did it.

189
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,100
- What was that?
- They'd say you did it.

190
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,132
- You what?
- Why'd you fill it with lizards?

191
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,570
They started coming out
as soon as you'd set it up.

192
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,532
- You filled your telly with lizards.
- Right.

193
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,050
l'm gonna get you fucking sacked.
What's your name?

194
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,172
- lt's Mr Lizard.
- Stop fucking me about.

195
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,132
- Fucking nincompoop.
- Come on, what is it?

196
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,136
Mr Lizard.

197
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,091
What's your boss's name?

198
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,098
- Another Mr Lizard.
- Stop it! Fucking stop it!

199
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,018
He's Mr Lizar-d.

200
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,732
(Mr Riley) Stop it!

201
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,250
Where you going?
Get back there and fix that TV!

202
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,894
- Where are you going?
- Lizard, lizard.

203
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,135
Get back in there and do that telly!

204
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,695
(Shouting) You can't leave!
A telly doesn't have lizards!

205
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,857
- (Screaming) You come here!
- Come on.

206
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,619
- l told him! He wouldn't listen!
- Come on.

207
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,571
(Ranting)

208
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,850
- Come on, come on.
- (Screaming)

209
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,289
(Shouting) What's wrong with it?

210
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,900
- Shh!
- The television...

211
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,057
- Stop it!
- (Screaming hysterically)

212
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,250
(Sobbing) ..television...

213
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,689
- Stop it!
- (Sobbing)

214
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,260
How much were you thinking of?

215
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,693
Well, 12o/o.

216
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,291
lf l give you 12o/o,
l have to do that for everyone.

217
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,539
Hm. lt's just that l've put in
a lot of extra time, you know.

218
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,130
At weekends and...evenings.

219
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,173
Every week for the past four months.

220
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,656
What if l give you...5o/o?

221
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,252
5o/o.

222
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,417
And l'll get Louise in here

223
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,896
and you can watch me
wrestle her to the ground

224
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,771
and sit on her head.

225
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,776
Eh?

226
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,254
And then fart on it?

227
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,738
What?

228
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,534
- You'd fart on Louise's head?
- Yes.

229
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,776
lt's the best l can offer you.

230
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,616
All right?

231
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,491
Yeah, OK.

232
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,136
Right. Louise, could you
pop through for a second?

233
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,456
- 'Certainly, do you want a coffee?'
- No, thank you.

234
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,850
Right, Louise, you know Andrew.

235
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,731
Hi, An...

236
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,771
Keep still or l'll break your neck.

237
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,017
- l can't breathe!
- Hang on, keep still.

238
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,369

- Ahh!

239
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,537
- Ahh!

240
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,298
What are you doing?

241
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,537
Can you just go? Please.
l will explain. Sorry.

242
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,571
You'd better go too, please.

243
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,651
Right. Thanks.

244

(lnaudible)

245
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,656
(Cash register beeping)

246
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,656
(Cashier) Bye.

247

(Man) Give me all the money in the till.

248
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,090
Give me all the money in the till.

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,491

250
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,294

the money, l'll shoot you.

251
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,334
Next, please.

252
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,177
l mean it.

253
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,299
Right.

254
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,179
(Gunman) Shit!

255
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,249
(Muttering)

256
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,499
(! Mellow instrumental track)

257
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,774
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

258
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,769
- Morning, Mr Ventham.
- Morning.

259
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,890
Erm, can l go straight in, please?

260

- No.
- Oh, dear.

261
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,170
He's running just a bit behind.

262
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,898
But if you'd like to take a seat,
l'll hurry him up for you.

263
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,771
Right, thank you.

264

Good morning, sir.

How can l help you?

280
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,413
Erm, l'm not sure where l put my wallet.

281
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,418
- Right.
- Couldn't find it this morning.

282
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,214
Do you remember where you last had it?

283
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,332
- No.
- l see.

284
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,496
Erm...

285
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,134
Well, have you looked in the kitchen?

286
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,250
- No.
- Hm.

287
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,890
Well...look in there

288
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,931
or in the bathroom.

289
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,130
Right. Kitchen or bathroom.

290
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,378
Hm. We often put our wallets down
in a silly place at night.

291
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,773
Yes.

292
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,618
- Probably on one of the surfaces.
- Right.

293
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,890
- Anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

294
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,976
Right. Shall l put that on account?

295
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,739
- Yes, please.
- Of course.

296
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,658
Help yourself to a shoe wire
if you like, sir.

297
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,131
Fits either shoe.

298
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,531
- Very discreet.
- Hm, yes.

299
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,970
Much better than
the old wooden shoe wires, sir.

300
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,658
Good.

301
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,932
- (Knock at door)
- Good. Well, goodbye, sir.

302
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,811
Yes, goodbye.

303
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,571
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

304
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,290
- Goodbye, Mr Ventham.
- Goodbye.

305
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,775
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

306
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,857
- A lovely shoe wire, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

307
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,573
Oh, most people wouldn't know, sir.

308
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,611
Oh... Yes.

309
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,810
- Goodbye, sir.
- Yes, goodbye.

310
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,340
Er, l'd just like to say to...

311
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,372
whoever took him...

312
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,376
we don't know who you are...

313
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,570
Or why you...

314
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,975
But he's only four years old.

315
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,258
So if you're watching...

316
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,098
- (! Tinny music)
- ! Please bring him back

317
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,971
! Please, just bring him back

318
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,218
! He's still our little angel
and we love him very much

319
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,058
! So if he's still alive

320
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,978
! Please, just bring our little Billy back !

321
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,132
Thank you.

322
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,330
(Applause)

323
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,096
(Man) 'The playgroup phoned up

324
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,849
'and said they'd found her
eating a dead bird.'

325
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,368
(Woman) 'All feathers in her mouth.'

326
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,540
(2nd woman)
'We got a phone call one day

327
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,458
'saying she'd wandered
into a police station

328
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,809
'with her pockets full of heroin.'

329
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,498
The competition to get into
the best schools is pretty intense

330
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,691
and you have to use
whatever methods you can.

331
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,858
(Woman) And to be certain
that Alex gets in,

332
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,688
we're having to ensure
that a lot of the opposition don't.

333
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,177
Just a bit worried about a little boy
who lives in Furle Street.

334
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,457
Andrew Pearce.

335
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,412
We saw him incinerating a live crow.

336
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,974
Could have been a squirrel,
it was a bit charred.

337
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,218
'l do have some pictures, actually.
My husband has a lens.'

338
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,218
l think l've seen him driving a car as well.

339
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,340
'He's three.'

340
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,612
(Man) 'lt's often best
to go directly for the kids.'

341
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,128
Getting them drunk's pretty effective.

342
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,936
- Hi, Marina.
- Hello, Daniel.

343
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,369
- l've brought Marcus home.
- Marcus!

344
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,015
- He was on the green. l think he's drunk.
- (Man) Who is it?

345
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,574
lt's Marcus, he's drunk!

346
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,339
Yeah, he had some
empty beer cans with him.

347
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,416
What on earth's going on?

348
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,291
He stinks of beer!

349
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,729
Oh, he had this with him as well.

350
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,375
Er, there's a couple
of smoked ones in there.

351
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,980
Well, if there's anything l can do...

352
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,580
- Thanks, Daniel.
- You know my number.

353
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,212
Thanks very much.

354
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,820
'lt would be better
if we didn't have to do this

355
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,057
'but it's not our fault
there aren't enough places.'

356
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,897
These work.

357
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,412
Puts a serious blot
on a child's reputation.

358
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,252
You know what you've got to say?
''More porn now''.

359
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,336
More porn now.

360
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,408
l reckon we've eliminated
about 20 kids so far

361
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,179
and, erm...

362
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,611
we're mopping up the rest by making
them obsessed with pornography.

363
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,097
Now say, ''l want porn. l want porn.''

364
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,973
l want porn. l want porn.

365
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,729
Really hit that when you say it.
''l want porn!''

366
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,489
- l want porn!
- Good girl. Well done.

367
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,657
l think we pretty much
guaranteed our Alex a place

368
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,895
when we cut off his little finger.

369
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,450
lf they don't give him a place now...

370
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,491
l will be fucking livid.

371
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,772
(Echoing) 'Livid. Livid. Livid.

372
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,733
'Livid. Livid. Livid.

373
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,010
(Fading) 'Livid...'
