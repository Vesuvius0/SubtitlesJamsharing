l prefer to travel in the boot.

- Really?
- Feels safer.

- Good girl.

- How long do you think now?
- Could be any time now.

Baby's head's nearly through.

- Brian?

(Squealing and gasping)

- (Knocking)
- Come in.

42
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,697
- Morning, Doctor.
- Morning.

43
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:58,739
- Paul Coffee?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,461
Now, spread your glutes.

45
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,978
So...what seems to be the problem?

46
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:08,418
l've done all these muscles
under my arm

47
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:11,062
- lifting a crate awkwardly.
- Hm?

48
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:14,737
lt was all right till this morning
but l can't move this shoulder now.

49
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,383
- Right. lt's just around there, is it?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,147
l see. Well, l think
what l'm going to do is,

51
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:24,419
l'm going to do this
over the phone, all right?

52
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,777
Just wait here while l go next door.

53
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:30,582
l'll ring through
and you answer the phone, OK?

54
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,107
Um, all right, then.

55
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,026
Right, l'll speak to you in a moment.

56
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:48,822
- (Phone rings next door)
- Good, Paul.

57
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:52,065
Now, tell me again
exactly where the pain is.

58
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,942
- (Muffled voice through wall)
- Could you hang on a moment?

59
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:01,222
Look, er, could you keep
your voice down?

60
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,066
There's no point in me doing this
over the phone

61
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:06,827
if l can hear you
through the door, is there?

62
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:09,905
- Er, no.
- Just speak a little bit more quietly.

63
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,826
(Door closes)

64
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:18,866
Now, when did this start?

65
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:26,420
Look, l'm sorry, this isn't a very good
line. Could you ring me back?

66
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,585
Yep, it's 302. Thanks.

67
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,818
(Rings)

68
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,666
Hello, Barn Green Health Centre.

69
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:41,786
Sorry, who is this?

70
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:44,506
Paul Coffee?

71
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:47,267
Well, l can't see you now,
l'm with a patient.

72
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:51,064
Look, is this an emergency?

73
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,777
Well, come in on
Thursday morning, then.

74
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,739
Er, hello?

75
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,177
- Doctor?
- Hang on, l'm on the phone.

76
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:05,506
- l just wondered if...
- Could you wait through there?

77
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:08,779
l'm sorry about that. Now...

78
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,307
Hello?

79
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,026
Ah, there you are.

80
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:16,299
Erm, ten o'clock on Thursday, all right?

81
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:20,460
OK, l'll see you then.

82
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:24,183
And go through reception next time,
l'm not the secretary.

83
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:26,184
All right, bye.

84
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,823
Right, so...

85
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,780
what's the story?

86
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:43,184
- l've gotta come back Thursday.
- l'll see you then.

87
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,059
Right...

88
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:48,384
- Doctor, is there no way...
- Ten o'clock?

89
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:50,544
(Paul) Right. (Sighs)

90
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:57,180
- But...
- Yes?

91
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,459
- Nothing.
- All right.

92
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,107
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

93
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:34,145
- Morning, Mr Ventham.
- Morning.

94
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,702
Please take a seat,
he'll be with you shortly.

95
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,023
Right. Thank you.

96
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:48,380
Mr Ventham's waiting for you.

97
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,896
Thanks.

98
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:02,823
(Mumbling) Erm...

99
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,745
Quite, erm...

100
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:09,100
- That's quite a nice, erm...
- Sorry?

101
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:15,941
l said tha-that's...erm, that's...
on the-the balcony, there, it-it's, erm...

102
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:18,627
Sorry, l can't hear you.

103
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,545
l was, l was...

104
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:25,668
Erm, l was just saying,

105
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,747
there's, erm, quite a pretty dove
on the balcony there.

106
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:32,541
lt's gone now.

107
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:34,863
Yes, l can't see anything there now.

108
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:38,059
No-No, it's, er, gone now...

109
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:41,305
Which is, er, quite a pity, because, erm...

110
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,257
(Woman) Hmm.
(Ventham) Oh, dear.

111
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,939
Shall l... Shall l sit down again?

112
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:57,661
Yes, he'll be with you shortly.

113
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:08,503
Yes, it's, erm...a great shame...

114
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,460
- a shame to have missed it...
- (Phone)

115
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:16,382
- Hmm.
- (Woman) OK, thanks.

116
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:19,181
He's ready for you now, Mr Ventham.

117
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,743
Right, thank you. That's, er...

118
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:30,858
- Ah, Mr Ventham.
- Morning.

119
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,660
Good morning, sir.

120
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:41,140
- How could l help you?
- lt's about this Saturday evening.

121
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,385
- Yes?
- l'm not quite sure what to do.

122
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,066
Right.

123
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:49,817
Well, a pleasant option might be
to call up a couple of friends,

124
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:52,940
meet up in a nice pub
and maybe go and see a play.

125
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,582
- All right, sir?
- (Meekly) Yes, thanks.

126
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,540
- Not at all. Anything else, sir?
- No, thanks.

127
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:02,625
- Shall l put that on account?
- Yes, please.

128
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,501
Of course, sir.

129
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:08,824
Help yourself to a finger bell
if you like, sir.

130
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:11,257
Oh, thanks.

131
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:14,220
Always handy to dispel a nasty silence.

132
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:17,180
- (Tinkling)
- Yes, indeed.

133
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:24,346
- Right, well, thanks very much.
- Not at all, sir, goodbye.

134
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,379
Goodbye.

135
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:35,144
- (Woman) Bye, Mr Ventham.
- Yes, erm...

136
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,700
Did you, by any chance,
see the dove again?

137
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:42,263
- No.
- Oh, right. Pity. lt's, erm...

138
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,697
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

139
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:49,860
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

140
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:52,661
- Lovely bell, sir.
- Thank you very much.

141
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,303
- Good choice for the ladies.
- Mmm, it's er...

142
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,581
(Slowed-down, distorted howls of pain)

143
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:13,177
As an actress l've seen the gush
up close and it's not pretty.

144
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:17,267
Guy gets locked into an ejaculation
and doesn't stop until he's dead.

145
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,823
(Dutch accent) For me right now
l think the biggest problem -

146
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:24,827
my biggest fear - is the gush.

147
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:28,577
First person who ever got
the gush was Dean Dorsey,

148
00:11:28,628 --> 00:11:30,220
and l've seen the clip

149
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:33,066
and...he's doing the snot shot.

150
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:38,743
And, er, suddenly there's just like
a look of panic on his face.

151
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,619
- Oh, God!
- (Woman screaming)

152
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,785
He's staring down at his prick
and he's whimpering,

153
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,547
''Oh, my God'',
like a sad-voiced freaky clown.

154
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:51,582
With the tears in his voice,
but they are not there. lt is tragic.

155
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,665
(Actress) Oh, they tried
throwing ice on his balls,

156
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,542
they tried to destimulate him
with a dog carcass but...

157
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:02,057
the guy just kept popping the protein.

158
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:05,180
(Dutch man) 'The next guy
was Mickey Vunglenger,

159
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,662
'who got the gush
filming Room Nation 7.'

160
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,699
lt took him three days to die,

161
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:12,308
all the while he was frying the fuck juice

162
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,658
and when they weighed his body
it was maybe 20 kilos,

163
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,381
which is no more than
two or three squirrels.

164
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:21,147
(Actress) 'A guy with the gush
is in big demand

165
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:24,817
'for cream scenes all over town.
There are agents for it.'

166
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:27,302
Trying to cram in
as many jobs as possible

167
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,703
before the spunk turns red.

168
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:33,377
lt comes out red and then goes black,
and you better make sure

169
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:36,500
you're not piling the pearls
into St Peter's dress!

170
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,699
Because, er,
in the reality perception it is tragic.

171
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,979
There is no way of laughing
at this with your own cock.

172
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,462
This is why l will only do softcock now,

173
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:48,306
which is where you push it in
with the thumb

174
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:52,057
or a little spatula called a winklepoker,
and it is flaccid.

175
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:57,501
- Big soft dick.
- Oh, soft cock, oh...

176
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,300
And a soft cock is no fun,

177
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:02,818
it is like trying to tighten up
a screw with a maggot.

178
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:06,702
And when you have to
stay soft as a mouse

179
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:09,421
in a big sexy twat...it is tricky.

180

'But, in the end, it is better
than clutching your nuts -

How are you?

186
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:35,979
All right? l'm not.

00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:38,747
(Sobbing)

188
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,586
l've got you one last present,
Martina - there it is -

189
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,142
so you can watch yourself getting it...

190
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:47,541
over and over again.

191
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,022
Keep watching, just keep watching.

192
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:52,707
l'm coming, Martina, l'm coming.

193

Here l come - keep watching, Martina.

194
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:02,580
- (Shouts) Martina! Martina!

195
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:09,547
- (Motor starts)
- Bob?

196
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:14,581
- l'm coming back, Martina!
- Bob!

197
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:17,779

- (Screaming)

198
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:21,457
(Bob laughing madly,
groaning ecstatically)

199
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,937
(Robotic voice) Yesterday,

200
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:39,978
we saw Richard Madeley

201
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,741
beating up a cleaner

202
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:54,380
and later being apprehended

203
00:14:55,428 --> 00:15:00,343
for fucking a coffee machine.

204
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:15,738
(Knocking)

205
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:21,264
- Hello?
- (Man) Ah, Mrs Cahill?

206
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:23,776
Robin Lomax. l've come about the boiler.

207
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:26,058
(Mrs Cahill) Ah, yes, come in.

208
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:29,942
- Thank you very much.
- He's just upstairs.

209
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:33,025
- Sorry, ''he'' is upstairs?
- lt shouldn't take long.

210
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:36,140
He's only three weeks old,
it's not at all much, is it?

211
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,065
Er, what do you mean ''he''?

212
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:41,305
My son Matthew, his room's
just at the top of the stairs.

213
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,738
- l've come about the boiler.
- Did l say boiler?

214
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,507
- Yeah.
- Oh, l'm sorry, l meant baby.

215
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:48,981
Baby?

216
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:51,542
Yes, please.
The doctor won't do anything,

217
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:54,819
says he's dead or something
but l know he can be mended.

218
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:58,417
lt's just tubes, really,
and l'm sure you'd have a go.

219
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:02,507
Mrs Cahill, l can't fix a baby,
l'm just a plumber...

220
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:05,824
Yes! And so you're good at mending.

221
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:09,747
You fixed the taps, you must be able
to do something for him.

222
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:13,497
- Yeah, l fixed the taps...
- They've never dripped since.

223
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:16,699
l'm sure you can -
what's more important, a baby or a tap?

224
00:16:16,748 --> 00:16:19,626
- That's not really the point.
- He's so young,

225
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:22,580
only three weeks,
they're meant to last longer,

226
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,380
my sister's had one for years.

227
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:28,137
He only stopped four days ago,
my husband will be so pleased,

228
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,827
he says he'll leave
if l keep on about the tubes.

229
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:34,178
l'm sure there's something you can do
for £1 ,000 an hour.

230
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:39,464
- For what?
- £1 ,000 an hour.

231
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:43,023
Couldn't you try for three hours
at £1 ,000 an hour?

232
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,780
- Well...
- Two or three hours?

233
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:53,300
- At £1 ,000 an hour?
- Yes.

234
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,618
Well, l-l could have a look...

235
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:05,136
Yes, just pop up and fix him,
l'm sure you can.

236
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,497
- l'll get my tools.
- Thank you so much.

237
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,699
- l'm not promising...
- No, but you'll do your best.

238
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:13,979
- Well, l...
- God bless you, Mr Robin Lomax!

239
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:27,861
- Mrs Cahill.
- Oh, is he better?

240
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:30,706
You'd better come and...

241
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:34,182
Matty! lt's Mum.

242
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:38,301
(Lomax) He's not quite...
He's changed a bit.

243
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,897
- Hello, darling! Mummy's here.
- (Steam rushing)

244
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:43,506
He's nice and warm.

245
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:47,507
l've channelled the heating through him.

246
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:51,223
Th-There's a tap on the side there.
See? Just there...

247
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:54,101
Tap? l've never seen
a tap as smart as that!

248
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:57,857
- Attached to the header tank.
- (Mrs Cahill cooing)

249
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:03,221
lt should make the, er, plughole
in his mouth gurgle when you turn it on.

250
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:05,338
(Mrs Cahill) Oh, yes!

251
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:08,698
- l'll just, er...
- Going to gurgle?

252
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:13,378
- (Gurgling)
- Oh, a gurgle!

253
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:17,580
l think, er, l think l'll get off now,
Mrs Cahill.

254
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:21,143
- Oh...thank you.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:24,783
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, bye.

256
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:27,547
(Cheerily) Bye!

257
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:31,058
Come on, Matty... Ooh, you're hot!

258
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:35,898
Yes, you are! Because of your pipes,
because of those smart pipes.

259
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,543
l think Dad will like the pipes,
l think he'll like them a lot.

260
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:42,705
l don't think he'll go
when he sees your pipes, will he?

261
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,898
(Gunman) 20 Benson & Hedges!

262
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:13,506
- Careful!
- (Cash register beeps)

263
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:16,620
Do you want the change?

264
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:22,063
Of course l want the change,
what do you think the gun's for?

265
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,383
For the cigarettes.

266
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,939
Hm?

267
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:30,627
You didn't have to pay for the cigarettes.

268
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:38,419
Well, give me my money back, then.

269
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:43,383
How much was the change?

270
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:46,898
Er, you don't need
to give me the change.

271
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:51,379
The gun?

272
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:07,901
- (Sniffs)
- What's the matter?

273
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:11,145
l can't feel my cock.

274
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:21,863
(Man) l'm 46 years old,

275
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:25,787
l've, erm, had a very successful career.

l've got a wonderful marriage,
two delightful children,

277

278
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:36,302
l've decided that, since life is so good

279

280

and burial now,

281
