Mm.

Oh.

Have you had acupuncture before?

No.

Hilary Chivers?

No, l jumped the queue.
l needed to ask you about this.

71
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:33,101
Did you really prescribe
my daughter half a kilo of heroin?

72

Hm.

73

l'm sorry, l can't see a thing.

Well, can't you...?

77
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:09,466
Thursday morning?
We can book you a proper appointment.

78
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,783
- Right.
- Good.

79
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:23,707
Sarah, l've just blinded myself.

80
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,899
Could you cancel
the rest of my appointments?

81
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,979
Thanks. Um...

82
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:33,782
l'll probably need someone
to lead me out to my car.

83
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,425
OK.

84
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:48,540
l just don't think
we can stretch to 280,000.

85
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:52,062
What was your maximum?

86
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:54,099
(Man) 240.

87
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,783
He is prepared to accept an offer.

88
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:01,178
Of 240?

89
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:05,301
Well, he'll take 250.

90
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:10,946
But there would have
to be an arrangement.

91
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,424
Arrangement?

92
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,698
Yeah.

93
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:19,308
What sort of arrangement?

94
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:23,179
A...

95
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:25,378
sex arrangement.

96
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:32,658
He'd want sex in return
for dropping the price.

97
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:40,707
12 times before
the exchange of contracts.

98
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:42,739
Linus...

99
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:45,898
- 12 times?
- No.

100
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:51,338
- lt's our only chance.
- l can't have sex with him.

101
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,747
- No, not really.
- lt's a fantastic house.

102
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:03,383
- Wouldn't you mind me...?
- Of course l'd mind but...

103
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:05,737
lt's the only way to get the house.

104
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,260
(Sighs)

105
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,747
Would he accept six times?

106
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:15,665
Has she had any children?

107
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,097
Have you had any children?

108
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,784
One.

109
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:25,183
Ask her if it caused any damage.

110
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,697
Did it cause much damage?

111
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,979
Not really, no.

112
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,064
That's good.

113
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:40,222
He would accept seven penetrations

114
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:44,102
four oral sessions and one of...

115
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,424
- Bagpiping.
- Bagpiping.

116
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:49,698
What's bagpiping?

117
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:53,138
lt's where he puts himself
in your armpit.

118
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,304
Quite a good mouth, yes.

119
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:59,021
Hm?

120
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:03,658
Mr Lulch could do the oral sessions.

121
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,381
Me? l-l don't think...

122
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,464
Then yes, we'll do it.

123
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:15,062
l mean, are you sure
you'd be all right with eight?

124
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:18,259
l mean, even if l'm sharing...

125
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,707
Yeah.

126
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:22,216
- l think we need more time...
- lt's fine.

127
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:24,065
- No, we...
- lt's OK.

128
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:26,099
Shall l give him a call?

129
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,499
Mm.

130
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:41,027
Hello, Mr Gardine?
Hester Twunt from Bovril's...

131
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,660
(Grunting, gasping)

132
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,698
(Muffled groans)

133
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:11,617
Well, l must say, you have both
been very accommodating so far.

134
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:18,141
(Exhales)

135
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:23,662
ls there any chance
we can leave it at 1 1 sessions?

136
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,581
(Tuts) And miss today's session?

137
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,425
Mm.

138
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,859
l was so looking forward
to today's session.

139
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:42,781
And there is another factor
to do with the house.

140
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,944
Oh?

141
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:48,867
Um, it's just since the last session...

142
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:54,904
l have actually had an offer of £300,000.

143
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:01,746
You know we can't pay more than 250.

144
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:10,699
Perhaps we'd better
extend the arrangement then.

145
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:18,462
To...nine more sessions?

146
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:20,499
(Linus) Nine?

147
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:26,341
Or l could sell to the other party.

148
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,577
Does the sex have to be with us?

149
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:49,379
Can we get someone else in?

150
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:54,626
- Louise.
- Louise?

151
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:58,259
She's very attractive

152
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:02,426
and she wouldn't mind
what you do so much.

153
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,944
She's as attractive as you?

154
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:11,421
Yes.

155
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:14,665
- She's my sister.
- You could have 12 sessions.

156
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,462
- We can't offer...!
- You want another nine with that?

157
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:24,979
What's the catch?

158
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,496
She's a bit uncomplicated.

159
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:32,624
She would be happy
to go through with this?

160
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,786
(Mrs Lulch) Well, it wouldn't...
lt might not matter.

161
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:40,059
- Wouldn't it?
- Linus is her legal guardian.

162
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:43,378
Oh.

163
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:48,060
12 times with your sister.

164
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,219
Who has a legal guardian.

165
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:56,542
Would you knock another
£10,000 off for 25 sessions?

166
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,019
25 sessions?

167
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,459
Yeah, l suppose so.

168
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,903
(Gasping excitedly)

169
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,346
Hello, Louise.

170
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:41,618
- (Linus) She's been fed.
- Oh.

171
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:45,747
Glad to see she's got your mouth, Linus.

172
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,701
- Say goodbye, Louise.
- Bye-bye.

173
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,739
(Both) Bye.

174
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,938
Oh, Louise...

175
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,979
look what l've found.

176
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:24,786
Well, the idea...was to get the guy

177
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,945
to hand over the money in the till

178
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:30,138
by threatening him with an axe.

179
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:38,546
The only trouble was
the day l went in with the axe

180
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:41,102
wasn't the same day

181
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,185
as the day l made
the threatening gestures.

182
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:50,662
So even though
l said l would chop him up,

183
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:55,259
he found it pretty easy to ignore me.

184
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:08,183
Must be about six months ago l...

185
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:11,903
moved out of the house
and started living outside.

186
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:15,987
'The idea came from a book
l was reading, l think.

187
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:20,226
'Can't be, er,
quite sure about that but...'

188
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:23,863
lf you think about it
we don't need central heating,

189
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:28,379
big kitchens, rugs, huge beds.

190
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,419
lt's all nonsense.

191
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:33,141
We don't need them but they're jolly nice.

192
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,179
They're useless really.

193
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:38,061
'l can sleep anywhere l want now,

194
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:41,737
'l can sleep under a hedge
or in the tractor shed.'

195
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:45,667
(Woman) 'lt does worry me
when it's awfully cold.'

196
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,702
Cattle. Bedding down with the cattle,
that keeps you warm.

197
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,216
At least then you get a little bit of heat.

198
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,943
l do worry when
l know Anthony's out in the open

199
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:59,786
on a particularly bleak night.

200
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,023
Rain, sleet...

201
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:07,627
There's a lot of food
in the kitchen garden,

202
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,943
some stuff round the bins.

203
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:16,257
A blackbird flew into the greenhouse
the other day and l picked him off.

204
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,663
He didn't taste too great, l must say.

205
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,781
- We're having lamb tonight.
- Sometimes l fight the cats for food.

206
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:25,467
Richard's bringing Helen for supper.

207
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:27,499
The dog's pretty loyal.

208
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:31,860
We blocked off that draught.
lt's awfully snug now.

209
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,547
(Anthony) 'l do occasionally find myself

210
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:39,184
'staring in through the drawing-room
window rather wistfully

211
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:42,664
'and looking at
the cosy scene there, the big fire.'

212
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,699
(Woman) 'Yes.'

213
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:47,660
(Anthony) 'And the family, all together.'

214
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,144
(Woman) 'You cut a pretty
sorry sight out there.'

215
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:55,181
l think all l'd have to do is
walk in through the front door

216
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:59,460
and l could have a nice hot bath
and a big plate of eggs...

217
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,624
- Some tea.
- Mm.

218
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:04,341
Why don't you come in tonight, darling?

219
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:08,301
Can't indulge that thought,
it's dangerously persuasive.

220
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:10,339
Just for an hour or so.

221
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:13,824
l think that's the main problem actually,

222
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,223
living with that contradiction.

223
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:20,899
'Er, the only comfort is that

224
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:25,499
'l don't suppose l'll have
to live with it quite so long.'

225
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:28,824
l imagine being picked off
by a sharp frost in the winter.

226
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,859
That's probably true.

227
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:35,379
But l suppose if l did go inside, l, er...

228
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:38,864
wouldn't have to live with it at all really.

229
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,581
l never lock up at night, you know.

230
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,426
Just doesn't bear thinking about.

231
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:52,297
(Anthony) 'And you should lock up.'

232
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,299
(! Ambient soundtrack)

233
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:02,507
Did you mention to Jill
how much Ted liked his Lego?

234
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,540
He's made a great spaceship.

235
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,299
Yeah.

236
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:12,419
She was worried it might be
a bit old for him.

237
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:16,347
(Man) Well, he is pretty bright
for a seven-year-old.

238
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,787
Mm.

239
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:22,265
lncidentally, did he come home
from school today?

240
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,142
No.

241
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:30,179
No, he didn't.

242
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:36,183
Should've been home about
six hours ago, shouldn't he?

243
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:38,219
Yeah.

244
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:42,226
Do you think we should call someone?

245
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,862
Nah.

246
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:50,665
(Yawning) He probably decided
to stay overnight at the school.

247
00:19:57,548 --> 00:20:01,860
Hello? Hi, it's Sue Jails here.

248
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:07,706
Just calling about Ted in primary three.

249
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:14,747
Just wondered if he's been standing
outside the school for a couple of weeks.

250
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,699
Oh, right.

251
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,744
She saw a bloke pick him up.

252
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:24,420
Yeah.

253
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,936
Did the man have a car?

254
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,467
Yeah.

255
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:30,863
Good, it was horribly rainy.

256
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,421
(Phone)

257
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:43,265
Hello.

258
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,458
Speaking.

259
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,421
Oh, have you? Right.

260
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:52,538
They've found a body, love.

261
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,146
(Woman) Oh!

262
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,497
Yah. Um...

263
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,782
They want us to go over
and identify him.

264
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,343
(Tuts) Can't they bring him round?

265
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:11,304
Yeah, we're just sort of, um,
doing something at the moment.

266
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:15,180
Um, how about bunging him in a cab?

267
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:19,665
- Mm. All right.
- What about his glasses?

268
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:24,304
Oh, yeah. ls he wearing
blue plastic-framed glasses?

269
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:27,664
Make him look rather studious?

270
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,185
Oh, well, l'm pretty sure that's him.

271
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:35,788
That's good enough for us, yeah.

272
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:40,106
OK. Thanks a lot. Cheers.

273
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,139
So what's that, love?

274
00:21:42,188 --> 00:21:44,304
We've got to bury him ourselves.

275
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:47,503
Did they say what had happened?

276
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:50,620
Sounds like he was buggered
quite a lot and then strangled.

277
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,659
That's a bit much.

278
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,383
Apparently it was that bloody
Mike Holland that did it.

279
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,658
l'll have a word with him when l see him.

280
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:03,498
Yeah. You can tell him
l'm pretty pissed off as well.

281
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:05,539
Mike Holland.

282
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:09,945
Well, l've always thought
he was a bit of a twit.

283
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,979
Mm.
