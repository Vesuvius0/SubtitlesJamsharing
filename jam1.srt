Mess?

32
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,978
And we felt because
you are Ryan's godfather...

33
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,380
you could help.

34
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,104
(Max) Right.

00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,901
Take my place for a bit.

You see, Ryan met
this guy Dave at the pub.

38
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:48,984
We had...pretty strong
suspicions about Dave.

39
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,185
He's a bit, er...

40
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,180
You know.

41
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,781
Oh.

42
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:07,346
And we really didn't want
Ryan going that way.

43
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,386
Oh, no.

44
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,426
So, er, l went to the pub and met Dave

45
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,907
to take his mind off of Ryan.

46
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,620
Mm-hm.

47
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:31,627

(Woman) ln bed. Bend over in bed.

52
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,498
(Martin) Keep him away from Ryan.

53
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,858
Oh.

54
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,301

55
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:06,228
More than three times
a day at weekends.

56
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,539
l need a break, Max.

57
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:17,786

just for a couple of weeks.

lf you drink quite a lot, it's not so bad.

00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:32,102
And he gives you this sniffing stuff

61

62

doing my bit too, Max.

66
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,302
(Martin) Anne's been
going to bed with Ryan

67
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,984
disguised as a younger lady.

68
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,385
(Anne) He doesn't know it's me.

69
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,546
l wear a crop top
and we meet in the dark.

70
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,545
He thinks l'm a prostitute.

71
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,586
Oh, my...

72
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,824

73
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:25,060
Can you help, Max?

74
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,547
Er...

75
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:31,466
Er, well...

77
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:40,101
(Martin, sighing) Thanks, Max.
(Anne) Yeah, thanks, Max.

78
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,985

79
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:49,385

'and, erm, l'd messed up
a couple of chances earlier on in my life.'

So l decided, erm, l'd marry myself.
l'd do it alone.

(Vicar) He has declared his marriage

166
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,668
by the giving and receiving of a ring.

167
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,587

00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,339
lt was...memorable.

171
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:58,777
Sometimes, er, l meet
a woman or a...a young girl

''Oh, l could've married her.''

175

No, £165 is the fine you have to pay.

l don't see why l should pay £165

No, you're not...

Right.

- No.

204

lt's an area where
there are parking meters, right?

Yes, l know what a parking meters are.

Right. Your Mr Hunter's
parking meter was over time.

208
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:04,583
He hasn't got a parking meter.

- The one he was at.
- He was at a meeting.

210

But his car was at a parking meter
and he didn't put enough money in it.

211
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,825
He puts his money in the car.

212
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:16,861
He should've put it in the parking meter.

213
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,740
No, he puts it in a tray.

214
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:23,499
l'm saying he didn't put enough
money in the parking meter.

And l just said
he puts his money in the car.

Not the car - l'm talking about
the parking meter, all right?

- What?
- He didn't put enough money in.

218

lt's not a parking meter, it's a car!

for a good ten minutes,

'just staring straight ahead of him.'

232
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:34,578
Then suddenly he swung his leg
over the parapet and, er...

233
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:37,780
dropped off.

234
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:40,622
He hit the ground very hard,

235
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:45,140
lay there stunned
for a second and then...

236
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,660
dragged himself to his feet
and went back inside.

237
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,143
About 30 seconds he reappeared again,

238
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,225
hurled himself off headfirst,

239
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,859
landed on his chin.

240
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:06,138
Got up again, staggered about,
went inside...

241
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:09,625
came out again onto the balcony,
dived off...

242
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:15,140
and did it again and again...

243
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:17,305
and again - he just kept on going.

244
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:22,823
'l couldn't hear anything
though the window was open until...'

245
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,780
The wind must have changed

246
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,378
and l could tell that he was sobbing
in quite a wretched way

247
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,383
and after about 20 jumps

248
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:35,580
there must have been
15 people just staring at him.

249
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:39,941
Nobody was raising a finger.
Didn't seem appropriate, really.

250
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:42,628
He seemed locked into a very private act.

251
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,426
Towards the end
they had to help him inside

252
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:50,063
because he was quite badly broken up.

253
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:53,579
l don't think he couldn't have made it
up the stairs by himself.

254
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:56,745
Then after about 40 jumps...

255
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:02,624
he just...didn't get up any more.

256
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:12,259
Apparently somebody asked him
what he was doing and he...

257
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,699
he said he wanted to jump
40 times off a first-floor balcony

258
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:18,502
rather than off the top of a tall building

259
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:22,861
in case he decided
to change his mind at any point.

260
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:28,101
But clearly he didn't.
