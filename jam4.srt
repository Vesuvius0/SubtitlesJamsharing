- Matthew Vockersbeige.
- Hm.

So.

26
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,027
What seems to be the problem?

27
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:56,106
Well, l'm quite sore
under this arm, just here.

28
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,585
Right. Well, undo your shirt
and let's have a look.

(Phone)

30
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,500
Hello?

31
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,347
(Matter-of-factly) Yes, l'm getting hard.

32
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,142
Very big and hard in my shorts.

33
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:15,023
Ah, l've come on my knee.

34
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,060
All right. Bye.

35
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,142
Erm...

36
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,465
Sorry about that but
there's quite a good reason for it.

37
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:27,979
Now, let's have a look at you.
Just lift your arm up.

38
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,702
Yes. Glands up there
are really quite swollen.

39
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,740
Do you have any other symptoms?

40
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,825
- (Phone)
- Oh, excuse me.

41
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,985
Hello?

42
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:45,341
Yes, l'm gliding my fist
over the bulging purple head

43
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:49,945
and sticking my finger up my arse

44
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,141
and my cock's gone off
like a spunky firework.

45
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:55,827
OK. Bye-bye.

46
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:59,225
- Doctor, l really don't...
- Erm...

47
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,306
l'm sorry about that.
l don't have much choice.

48
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,340
What do you mean?

49
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,028
We're short of cash at the health centre,

50
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,027
we've found this an efficient way
of raising funds.

51
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,902
- Oh.
- Let's have a look at you.

52
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,861
Strip down to your pants
and pop onto the couch.

53
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,348
- (Phone)
- l'll put on the headset

54
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,425
so that l can carry on with you.

55
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,778
Hello. Could you hang on a second?

56
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,104
Yes, just lie down.

57
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:32,507
Right. l'm staring down
at my very hard prick.

58
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,188
lt's a fucking massive bulb...

59
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,220
Won't be long.

60
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:44,060
..and l'm shooting jets of thick come
into your foaming twat.

61
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:47,580
Not at all, bye.

62
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,382
You don't seem to have
any other inflammation

63
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:53,546
but l'll check for glandular fever,
just in case.

64
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,898
But l wouldn't worry.

65
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,383
All right.

66
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,579
- Doctor?
- Yes?

67
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,268
ls that really the only way
you can raise money?

68
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,300
There are probably others

69
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,466
but it's the best one
we've come up with so far.

70
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:11,023
What's the money for?

71
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,867
lt's for a little girl with head cancer.

72
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,981
- Aren't there funds for that?
- You would have thought so.

73
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,180
- Yes.
- (Phone)

74
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,188
(Sighing) l'm sorry, l'll have to get that.

75
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:31,541
Erm, l'll see you again
when you've got the results. Bye.

76
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,341
Hello?

77
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,543
Yep, l've got a thick club
of pulsing gristle.

78
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,907
l'm pushing it into your soft, warm gob.

79
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,702
You're talking dirty past the shaft.

80
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:51,537
l'm coming so hard,
the spunk's flying out of your eyes.

81
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,580
OK. Bye.

82
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,948
That was for a child with head cancer?

83
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:02,026
Yes, l know. Unbelievable isn't it?

84
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,660
Right, then, Rosa.

85
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,143
- Erm, there you are.
- Thank you.

86
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,262
- There's a fiver from last week as well.
- Thank you very much.

87
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,779
- Rosa, can l ask you something?
- Yes?

88
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,185
- We think you do a very good job.
- Thank you.

89
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,178
l was just wondering if it would be
easier with another hoover?

90
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:40,508
- Another one?
- lt's just the one you use is very small.

91
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,983
Yes, very small, very good.

92
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,020
lt takes you two days...

93
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:50,062
hoovering all the big carpets

94
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:52,987
with this tiny little machine.

95
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,543
Yes, yes, very good for dust.

96
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:00,029
- Dust?
- Dust is very small.

97
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,264
Yes, dust is very small.

98
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:07,303
A big hoover is very big,
is too big for small dust. Dust is small.

99
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:14,067
l just think it would be better
with a bigger hoover, Rosa.

100
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,828
- You don't like my work?
- No, it's very good

101
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:21,147
but with a normal-sized hoover,
you'd be finished in half the time.

102
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,983
There is something wrong
with my small?

103
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,260
No, it's just that l can't work with this...

104
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,788
(Loud whirring)

105
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,265
..you know with that noise
in the house for two days.

106
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,379
lt drives me mad.

107
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,307
- Well, l don't know.
- We'll pay you the same.

108
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,340
l don't know.

109
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,425
Rosa.

110
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:49,228
Rosa, what's the matter?

111
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:52,705
Please, l must use my little hoover.

112
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,899
ls very good.

113
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,905
Look, look, all...

114
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,905
lf you want to, then yes

115
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,100
but only if you can
get the job done in one day.

116
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,140
- Three days.
- Three days?

117
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,499
l must have three days
for to do proper job.

118
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:12,178
- Three days.
- ls not possible two days no more.

119
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,821
Rosa...

120
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,258
l buy 20 of these.

121
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,618
What...what are these?

122
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,978
Brushes for the small mess.

123
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,428
Please, don't be cross, l do my best.

124
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,779
Please, l like it here very much.
l work hard.

125
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,787
Please, is no problem for me, three days.

126
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,865
- l know.
- Please, Mr Paul.

127
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,343
l do very good with the dust.

128
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,825
- (Sighs) Right.
- Every little bloody dust.

129
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,985
- Three days.
- Yes.

130
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:51,020
OK. OK.

131
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,788
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

132
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,142
- l go now.
- Yes.

133
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,180
Yeah.

134
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,141
- Bye.
- Bye.

135
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,067
(Phone)

136
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:09,658
Yeah, Paul Suss. Oh, hello, hi.

137
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,064
Yeah, fine.

138
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:14,828
No, yeah, yeah, she's gone.

139
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,781
Well, er, no, no.

140
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:23,586
She's, erm, she's actually
going to do three days now.

141
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,699
l know, l know, l know!

142
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:28,980
l got here, she had about
20 miniature brushes.

143
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:39,940
(Doorbell)

144
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,541
Hello?

145
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:56,342
(Muffled) 'Hello?'

146
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:04,222
- Erm, are you Maria?
- (Child) Yes.

147
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:08,065
Come in.

148
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,343
Where's the body?

149
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,744
lt's just through there.

150
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,338
How did it happen?

151
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:28,620
Er, we had a fight.

152
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,229
He fell down the stairs

153
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,942
and banged his head on the step.

154
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:38,341
Right, listen carefully
and do exactly as l say.

155
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,348
l need buckets, a saw,
an axe if you've got one,

156
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,620
an electric carving knife
and some rubber gloves.

157
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,705
Right.

158
00:09:56,989 --> 00:10:01,426
Everything l cut off,
you put into the bucket.

159
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,983
Feet first. Hold his shin.

160
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,508
(Knife whirring)

161
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,380
(Screaming)

162
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,306

Right. Thank you.

211
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,027
Erm, was it the ankle?

How can l help you?

Erm, my chin's been getting
rather hot lately.

217
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,904
Right.

218
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:28,306
l could arrange for
a delivery of chin coolant sachets.

219
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:33,264
Erm, would you prefer them
jaw-mounted or tie-mounted?

220
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,379
Erm, tie.

221
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,501
Right. A wise choice, if l may say so, sir.

222
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,825
ln the meantime,
l suggest that you lick your chin

223
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:44,861
and stand on a tall building
in a stiff breeze.

224
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,505
- All right, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

- Shall l put that on account?
- Yes please.

227
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,620
Certainly, sir.

228

231
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,903

237
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,978
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

238
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,418

00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:08,901
- Not too good, really.
- A bit tired.

244
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,782
l've just brought you a little something.

245
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,104
That's very nice, you shouldn't have.

246
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,822
Thanks, Barry. Sit down.

247
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,860
lt's very big.

248
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:20,900
lt's nothing.

249
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,098
Made it myself.

250
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,267
l thought it'd come in handy
for burying the old, you know...

251
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,619
Well...

252
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,379
Don't they use coffins
when they're that small?

253
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,064
No, you just take it away.

254
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,147
l thought l should take an interest,
seeing as...

255
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,622
Barry.

256
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,105
Seeing as what?

257
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:21,538
Seeing as, er...

258
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,820
What?

259
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,258
Well, seeing as it was mine.

260
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,580
(Man) Just get out.

261
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:41,585
Right.

262
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,982
Yeah.

263
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:53,743
Listen, Russ, it was just a one-off.

264
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,984
That's what you said, wasn't it?

265
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,463
Yeah.

266
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:06,821
You know, l don't think l could
afford that much again anyway.

267
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,097
! Did you give the world
some love today, babe?

268
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:23,457
! Did you give the world
some love today, babe?

269
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,380
(Both screaming in pain)

270
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,380
(Hooting)

271
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,265
(Slow monotone) 'l've, erm,

272
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:47,746

a lonely sort of person.

'l find it hard
to start conversations with people.

274

'l just imagine they'll find me boring.

275
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:05,061
'But of course, people never find
you boring if they need help.

276
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:09,227
'So l've started to make people
need help.'

277
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:13,825
- (Driver) Excuse me.
- Yes?

278
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:16,986
- Could you help me?
- What's the matter?

279
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,907
- l'm stuck.
- Sorry?

280
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:23,338
My hand is stuck on the door.

281
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,425
- Stuck?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:29,382
l think someone's put superglue
on it or something.

283
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:37,468
Oh, dear. l'm Lucy Tiseman.

284
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,104
Right. Could you call the fire brigade?

00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,344
Oh, yes, yes.

l've found bikes are quite easy
to bring down at night,

291
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,819
with a wire.

292
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,224
They don't know what's hit them.

293
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,260
Here's one.

294
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:25,627
(Lucy, laughing) Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

295
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,901
Are you all...all right?

296
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,782
- Hurts, my leg.
- Are you OK?

297
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,343
lt's my leg. (Groaning)

298
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,380
What's your name?

299
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,787
- Robert Caesar.
- Lucy Tiseman, how do you do?

300
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:46,901
Could you get me some help, please?

301
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:51,340
- Oh, yes, you'll need that.
- Thanks.

302
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:54,142
Do you like grapes?

303
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:55,702
What?

304
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:59,458
l could bring you
some grapes in hospital.

305
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,021
l've changed tactic recently.

306
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:10,220
l'm observing people at their houses,

307
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,785
so l can work out a reason
for paying them a visit.

308
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:20,301
(Lucy, quietly)
! Bye-bye, mm-mm, bye-bye !

309
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,340
(Lucy humming quietly)

310
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,667
Bye!

311
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,745
(Lucy humming)

312
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,780
(Doorbell)

313
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,582
(Woman) Hello.
(Lucy) Hello. Mrs Ferris?

314
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,859
- Yes.
- May l come in?

315
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:42,900
(Mrs Ferris) Yes.

316
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,259
(Lucy humming)

317
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,705
(Lucy) l'm afraid it's about Paul.

318
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,865
What?

319
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,298
We've been informed

321
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,985
(Gasping sob)

322
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:22,464
l'm very sorry, Mrs Ferris.

323
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,659
(Sobbing)

324
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,469
Must be quite a shock.

325
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,024
lt's very sad.

326
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:36,266
(Sobs) Oh.

327
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,507
l have actually got...

328
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,059
two tickets

329
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:48,819
to see Cats tonight.

330
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,826
Perhaps you'd like to see Cats with me?

331
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,588
Cats?

332
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:05,100
Shall l, erm, pick you up in a taxi?

333
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,065
- (Knocking)
- lt's probably the police at the door.

334
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:19,340
l think he's here about this man
l've electrocuted last week.

335
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,744
l told him l'd done it deliberately

336
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:24,984
to prolong the conversation.

337
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:33,621
We had an exciting chat
but l don't know if it was a good idea.

338
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,103
(Pounding at door)

339
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:40,060
(Lucy giggling)

340
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:42,100
(Door opening)

341
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:44,583
(Man) Good evening, Miss Tiseman.

342
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:49,180
Peter Lusp from ClD.
l've got a few questions l'd like to ask.

343
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:54,064
lt might take a little while so probably
best if we pop down to the station.

344
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:57,988
(Lucy) Have you caught me?
(Lusp) Come on.

345
00:23:58,029 --> 00:23:59,781
(Giggling maniacally)

346
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:03,538
(Lusp) Get in the car,
we'll go down the station

347
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:07,228
and have a chat, all right?
